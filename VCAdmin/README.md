This is the administrator interface for VolunteerConnect.

Currently, it displays the list of events and the list of organizations. The list of events can be filtered down based on geographic coordinates. Events and organizations can be added. When a new event is created, a link to that event is added to the appropriate organization's database file.

Running this interface requires PHP, a Couchbase server, and the Couchbase PHP SDK which can be found at http://www.couchbase.com/communities/php/getting-started.
